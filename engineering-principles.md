# VC Lab Engineering
## Engineering Principles

The ideal developer owns their project from start-to-finish. They can understand the requirements, work directly with stakeholders, ask questions when needed, but most importantly: 

### Ownership

Devs at VC Lab are not micro-managed because they OWN their projects and prove to everybody else on the team that they can think critically, build things that work, communicate clearly, with empathy for others, and ask lots of questions. 

You own whatever you are working on. We treat people as capable, independent knowledge workers.

If you work on something, you drive decisions:
- If you have a question, ask.
- If you are missing a design, mock the UI, designers can fill this in later
- If you don't know how to do something technically, hack it or fake it
- If a product decision is missing, try to make this decision yourself - it's better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission
- Take a feature and find solutions

### Small checkpoints

- We use trunk driven development
- Get feedback from the team early and often
- Try to get the feature to production as quickly as possible.
- Split features into multiple smaller releasable features

### The scout rule

[Leave the code cleaner than you found it](http://wiki.c2.com/?BoyScoutRule)

If you find messy code, make it better. If you donâ€™t understand at first how something works, leave some comments or refactor it. Clean up code as you go, this is a basic courtesy for your fellow devs.

- Any mistake you find and leave - is now also your mistake
- Any "wtf-moment" you run into is a chance for you to help somebody else avoid that feeling (add notes, introduce best practices, etc)
- If you can't take ownership, then we most likely have a more significant structural (process) problem at hand. Please address it to the team
- Don't ask if you can refactor
