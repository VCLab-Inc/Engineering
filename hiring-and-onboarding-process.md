# Decile Group Engineering
## Hiring and Onboarding Process

### Salary + equity

We offer competitive salary and sizable equity packages.

### The interview process

Our interview process is fast, but it's not easy!

1. Internal resume screen so we can make sure you're in a close enough time zone to work with us on Slack/Zoom and have the necessary experience
2. Complete a code challenge, tailored to the role you're applying for. Most people take ~2 days
3. A 20 minute screen to make sure you’re a good fit
4. A 30 minute meeting with Travis (Head of Tech) to get to know each other and explain the code challenge
5. Another interview with a co-founder of the company
6. Hiring decision

In almost every case (with specific exceptions), we require the coding challenge. If you’re not comfortable doing a coding project for us, then you’re probably not a good fit. Everybody on the team has done a coding challenge and we want to hire people who are as talented and excited about the mission as we are!

### Timing

Given that we’re a startup, we can move much faster than the tech behemoths. The entire hiring process should only take ~2-weeks from start-to-finish, mostly dependent on your availability to complete the code challenge.
