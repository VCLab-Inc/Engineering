# Team culture and work/life balance

## How much do we work?

We are a startup and we're trying to improve and expand an old industry, so yeah, we work hard. We will often put in a few hours at night or on the weekend, but never because it is required, only because _we want to_. And that's the defining feature of the small team we have now - we all love this job and buy into the mission of the company. We have ownership and we _want_ it to succeed, which makes working a few extra hours something enjoyable.

That being clear... We are all family people with significant others and kids, so a good work/life balance is important. We enjoy vacations and paternity leave and there's never a problem if somebody needs a day to move or recover. It's called trust and respect.

## How do we treat each other?
