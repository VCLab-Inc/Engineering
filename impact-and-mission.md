# Decile Group Engineering
## Impact & Mission

Decile Group believes that **the most impactful way to improve the future is to help diverse, worldwide entrepreneurs build a thriving business**. In order to build a business, entrepreneurs need access to capital. To do our part, we are helping to launch 1,000 enduring Venture Capital firms focused on positive impact in the next 4 years.

**Why it’s important to innovate Venture Capital:**

In today’s world, if you’re a smart person in Silicon Valley with ambition, a big idea, and a little traction, then you have a pretty good chance of raising money for your business. If you’re in LA, NY, Boston, Austin, Denver, Miami, it’s less likely, but still possible. If you’re anywhere else, especially if you’re outside of the United States, or an underrepresented demographic, then your chances of a successful raise are very low. We want to change this!

There are amazing entrepreneurs and huge opportunities all around the world. There is investor capital ready and waiting to be deployed. The big problem is that global legal structures are not simple, knowledge networks are all located in Silicon Valley, and there are no tools purpose-built for venture fund managers.

We have thousands of amazing, inspiring VCs apply for our VC Lab program every cohort - https://www.govclab.com - and we help them with knowledge, software, and networking to make their dream of starting a VC Firm and investing in startups a reality.

We are innovating Venture Capital from its roots, overhauling legal documents, creating accounting systems, and building networks. We are launching enduring, impactful VCs of the future, by the hundreds, and we need your help to do it.
