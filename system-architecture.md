# Decile Group Engineering
## System Architecture

We are a startup and the architecture is very simple. (And it would be great to keep it this way. A lot of complexity leads to a lot of future problems.)
- **Backend**: Rails + Postgres + Redis/SolidCache
- **Frontend**: Rails + Turbo + Stimulus + TailwindCSS
- **Hosting**: AWS
- **Tools**: Github, VS Code, Slack, Google Suite
