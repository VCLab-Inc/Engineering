# Decile Group Engineering
## Who you'd be working with

- The co-founder/CEO is [Adeo Ressi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeoressi/)
- The co-founder/Head of Acceleration is [Mike Suprovici](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesuprovici/)
- The Head of Product and Engineering is [Travis Giggy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travisgiggy/) ([personal website](https://travis.giggy.com/))

As an engineer on the team, youâ€™d be working primarily with Travis. He has been the first architect at two different companies that went from startup to unicorn. He also started and sold a multi-million-user app company, helped launch a Personal AI, Blockchain-for-supply-chain, and quantitative Private Equity firm.

The engineering team is talented and moves fast. They are co-located all over the world, but work with several hours of overlap with US/Pacific time for collaboration and communication.
