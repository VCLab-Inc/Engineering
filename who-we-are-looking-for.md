# Decile Group Engineering
## Who we are looking for

The ideal dev is self-motivated with real-world experience. You're either already a professional, or you have interesting side projects. There should be no question in your mind that you could take an idea and turn it into a functional and usable product.

You donâ€™t need a fancy degree, a certain number of years of coding experience, or big tech experience -- a couple of us are self-taught and have been incredibly successful (we have built multiple unicorns). You do need to have good English communication skills and enough emotional intelligence to work with other highly skilled and motivated people. You need to be able to spend at least a few hours in Pacific time zone every working day, because we work together on Slack/Zoom a lot.

If you're motivated to be more, and better, than you are today... If you're not afraid to work with proven, highly skilled people who will ask for your best... to advance a worthy cause... be a patient and skilled mentor/friend for other developers... in a fast-paced environment... with a lot of growth opportunity... then you're a good fit for Decile Group. (And we want to work with you too!)
