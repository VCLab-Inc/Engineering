# VC Lab Engineering
## Who we are looking for

The ideal dev is self-motivated with real-world experience. You’ve likely been an engineer in the tech industry for 5+ years. Maybe you have interesting side projects or weird passions, maybe you're self-taught. You probably have an odd obsession with keyboard shortcuts and coding efficiency that most people wouldn't understand. There is no question in your mind that you could take an idea and turn it into a functional and usable product.

Our kind of devs are confident and intelligent enough to work with people who have literally built multiple tech unicorns. You don’t need a fancy degree, a certain number of years of coding experience, or big tech experience -- but you do need to understand what empathy is, and have enough emotional intelligence to work with other highly skilled people.

If you're motivated to be more, and better, than you are today... If you're not afraid to work with proven, highly skilled people who will ask for your best... to advance a worthy cause... be a patient and skilled mentor for other developers… in a fast-paced environment... with a lot of growth opportunity... then you're a good fit for VC Lab.
